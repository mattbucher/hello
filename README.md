# hello
Just another repository

This is a generic template for testing features in github. I am a content developer, an editor, and a hobbyist of all sorts. Since 2009 I have maintained a tumblr of images I have found on Google Streetview. I also have a website devoted to the writing of Roberto Bolano. I have another personal site (mattbucher.com) and a site that exists for posts about David Foster Wallace and random projects. Since 2002 I have administered wallace-l, a listserv for fans of David Foster Wallace. The listserv is still quite active even 8 years after Wallace's death. Wallace-l has been thanked/acknowledged in some two dozen academic books. I live in Austin, Texas, home of the Harry Ransom Center, where Wallace's archive resides.
